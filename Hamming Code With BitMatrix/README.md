# Assignment 4

This program runs a (8,4) Hamming Code. A Hamming Code is a linear-error correcting code. It helps counteract noise by using vector-matrix multiplication and its transverse to confirm if there was inference or not. The system also has a set of values which determine what bit was affected by the interference, allowing the code to correct the issue. This particular file uses a bitmatrix and a hamming code multiplier. These are then accessed by the mains in the generator and the decoder.
