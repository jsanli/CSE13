# Assignment 5
The Purpose of this assignment is to simulate 4 different types of sorts, bubble, quick, shell, and heap in order to compare efficiency. The program does this all by creating 4 different c files to create functions and runs them all in the main to compare output. It compares efficiency by comparing moves and comparisons. The functino uses a set algorithm to determine what command line options to run and it also has a stack object in order to help with certain sorts.
