# Assignment 5
The purpose of this assignment is to filter out certain banned words. The program does this by using a bloom filter and a hashtable to create a list of words and then compare them to user input in order to determine if the user commited a thought crime. To create this the program implements a main and some helper funcitons contained in bf.c bv.c hash.c ll.c and node.c. We were also given speck.c and parse.c to help with certain aspects of the bloomfiler and parsing user input.
